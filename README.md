# Open Source Psychiatrist Appointment Booking System using PHP

This initiative facilitates online appointment requests for clients or patients of Psychiatric establishments. This project can also help Psychiatrists to manage their appointments with their patients. This psychiatrist's appointment system will organize the schedules of each patient's appointment, which will be submitted as a request to the psychiatrist they have selected. The system comprises three key roles: administrator, psychiatrist, and patient. The system admin will populate the list of the psychiatrists with their specialties and along with the psychiatrist details and system credentials. The patients can browse the psychiatrist appointment system website to find a psychiatrist that has the specialty of their needs. Patients can review the psychiatrist's weekly schedule, enabling them to select a suitable day and time for their appointment. Subsequently, they can submit their appointment request. After that, the psychiatrist can view all their appointments and the appointment request of the patients for their availability.
